# C++ Katas

This folder contains small practice programs based on *A Tour of C++*. Each file targets a focused topic like:

- Variable declarations
- Loops & control flow
- Basic functions
- Class syntax (single-file, no headers yet)

These are meant to build fluency before writing more modular or test-driven code.
