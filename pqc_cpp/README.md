# C++ Practice — pqc-journey

This folder contains all of my C++ code for the PQC roadmap.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `katas/`  
  Short, focused practice programs to build fluency with C++ syntax and concepts (loops, functions, basic classes).

- `data_structures/`  
  Larger implementations like arrays, linked lists, and trees, written and tested after learning modularity and classes.

## 🛠️ Build & Run (Basic)

To compile a `.cpp` file:

```bash
g++ -std=c++20 filename.cpp -o output
./output
