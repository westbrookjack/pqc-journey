> A structured roadmap and active project hub for my personal training in post-quantum cryptography (PQC) engineering.  
> Target: Land a PQC research/engineering role by Spring 2026

## 📍 Overview

This repo documents my long-term plan to become a production-level contributor to post-quantum cryptography projects, including:

- 🔐 Learning modern C++ and Rust through hands-on systems programming
- 🧠 Deep-diving the NIST PQC standards (Kyber, Dilithium, SPHINCS+)
- 🧮 Revisiting the underlying math: lattices, error-correcting codes, and finite fields
- 🛠️ Implementing and benchmarking cryptographic primitives
- 🧑‍💻 Building a public portfolio of secure, well-documented open-source code

---

## 📂 Folder Structure

- `caesar_cipher/` – A toy implementation of the Caesar cipher in Rust
- `rsa_toylib/` – Planned: Minimal RSA implementation in Rust
- `ecc_demo/` – Planned: Toy ECC over finite fields
- `phase-1-notes/` – Notes and deliverables from Phase 1 (CS + classical crypto)
- `phase-2-notes/` – NIST PQC algorithm analysis and test vectors (coming soon)

---

## 🚀 Current Phase

📌 **Phase 1: Core CS & Classical Crypto Foundations**  
🗓️ Jun 17 – Aug 10, 2025  
🔧 Status: Setting up Rust/C++ dev environment, practicing coding patterns, reviewing Big-O and classical crypto theory.

---

## ✅ Completed

- [x] Rust + C++ dev environment installed
- [x] Caesar cipher CLI implemented in Rust
- [ ] Coursera *Cryptography I* (in progress)
- [ ] RSA toy library (planned)

## 🧭 Weekly Logs

Every week includes:
- Daily task checklists
- Actual hours logged
- Key deliverables
- Personal reflections + blockers

You can follow my journey directly in Notion or clone this repo to explore the code.
